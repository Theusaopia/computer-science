## Computer Science
I'm studying computer science by myself, using three main sources of knowledge:

 - [Computer Science Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/computer-science)
 - [Teach yourself CS](https://teachyourselfcs.com)
 - [Open Source Society University](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science)

As I'm dealing with lots and lots of code, I need to store them somewhere.
